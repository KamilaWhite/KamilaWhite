✨ I am a **_Manual Tester_** with less than a year of experience. Recently, I have started to develop towards **_Automated frontend and backend tests_**.

✨ Privately, I am a wife and mother of two wonderful boys 😊. I love creativity, I try to use it on a daily basis and constantly develop it, as long as I have enough strength beyond my daily duties. In the past, I used every free moment for a whole lot of Handmade and what has become especially innovative for me - now I translate creative doing something interesting from nothing into **_writing code_** 😁 to create something functional and interesting based on my knowledge, using my hands constantly at the same time perfecting.

_____
✨ I invite you to read a **_piece of my work_**, to talk and constructive criticism 😏. I like to talk about interesting topics that **_allow me to discover a different point of view_** 😊.
